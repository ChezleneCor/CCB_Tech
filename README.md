The purpose of this inventory system is to streamline inventory count process and ordering additional products. The program includes a login page for customer security, seperate pages to track inventory and order more product, and a page to manage the systems users. The system will update the inventory each time a product is sold and it will also update when more items are added to the inventory as well. The application will feature an order system that allows users to order additional product and also update when those orders arrive and are inventoried.
